## Introduction
I started my blog on [blogger.com][blogger] because it seemed like a quick and convenient way to publish my occasional article about linux, life and technology. Blogger integrates quite nicely into all the other Google services; you can use google+ for comments, drive to store your pictures and adsense for monetization. Furthermore it features a rich text editor and a lot of themes and widgets to customize your blog.

But nevertheless I didn't feel quite at home. The initial loading animation before the page was displayed was annoying, I had no real control over the content (yay, the cloud!) and on top of that parts of the page were often missing if one of the content delivery servers didn't respond in time. Prime candidates for this kind of breakage were the top and the slide-in navigation. A blog with most of the navigation missing? No, thanks.

The solution: Running my own blog somewhere safe.

## The candidates
- wordpress -> php
- writing own blog engine with play! or rails -> overkill
- blogofile or jekyll -> jekyll because of ruby
