## Introduction
It finally happened. I got hooked on [Emacs][emacs] [org-mode][orgmode]. And the worst part: I felt right at home. Though some keybindings are still mind-boggling, Emacs is going strong to become my text editor of choice for most use-cases. (Don't worry VIM, I still love you, too) Org-mode on the other hand is going strong to become my PIM-tool of choice, at least for notes and todos and maybe a bit of my calendar.

After some fiddling with org-mode I reevaluated my use of Evernote and realized a few things:

1. Most of my notes are clipped articles or auto-generated.
2. Most of my hand-written notes are more often read than written.
3. Most of my notes were never accessed again.
