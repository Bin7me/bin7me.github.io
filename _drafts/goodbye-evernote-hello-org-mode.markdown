title: "Goodbye Evernote, Hello org-mode!"

## Introduction
It finally happened. I got hooked on [Emacs][emacs] [org-mode][orgmode]. And the worst part: I felt right at home. Though some keybindings are still mind-boggling, Emacs is going strong to become my text editor of choice for most use-cases. (Don't worry VIM, I still love you, too) Org-mode on the other hand is going strong to become my PIM-tool of choice, at least for notes and todos and maybe a bit of my calendar. Thus, I now have two tools trying to fill the same void in my life: Evernote and Org-mode. Evernote has a slick smartphone application and a polished web-interface, org-mode is free software and gives more geek-cred. Let's see if the latter can replace the former.

## Reevaluating Evernote
After some fiddling with org-mode I reevaluated my use of Evernote and realized a few things:

1. Most of my notes are clipped articles or auto-generated.
2. Most of my hand-written notes are more often read than written.
3. Most of my notes were accessed only a couple of times. (or never)
4. A lot of notes contain PDFs

Especially 1. and 3. might be a hint that Evernote was never really integrated into my daily workflow. Therefore migrating only the core of my notes to org-mode and ditching everything else will be enough.

## Requirements
To replace Evernote in my everyday work, org-mode has to be able to fullfill the following requirements:

1. Store hand-written notes. (as opposed to notes added by Clearly or the Web Clipper)
2. Store reminders and due dates for notes.
3. Store files along my notes.
4. Sync my notes to all my devices. (desktop, laptop and smartphone)
5. Edit notes on all my devices. (on the smartphone reading is more important!)
6. Capture notes from my Twitter and Facebook feed.

The first three points are easy to fullfill, that's what org-mode was made for.
